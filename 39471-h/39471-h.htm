  <p>The termination of the first volume of the Zoological Illustrations is
  accomplished, and its contents will not only enable our readers to
  discern the nature of the work, but likewise to form a judgement, on that
  degree of improvement which we have introduced since its first
  publication, and they may safely rely on the continuation being in no
  respect inferior.</p>

  <p>In commencing a work of this nature, we have had two principal objects
  in view: the diffusion of original observations, which, while they might
  further the ends of science, would also be interesting to the general
  reader; and that of discouraging the publication of distorted figures
  copied from old authors, by accustoming the public eye to original
  designs and correct representations of natural objects. How far we may
  have succeeded in this latter object, remains to be judged by others; we
  are however satisfied with having made the attempt, and we hope that
  abler pencils than our own, may engage in the prosecution of this most
  desirable object; for it is only by the publication of original matter,
  that a check can be given to the increasing number of compilations and
  multiplied copies of "ill-shaped" figures, by which error is perpetuated,
  and science retarded.</p>

  <p>The only original work that has appeared in this country similar to
  our own, is the Zoological Miscellany by Dr. Leach, which, as it was
  discontinued after the third volume, it may be presumed was unsuccessful:
  although little can be said of many of the figures in the early volumes,
  those in the latter are much to be praised, and the whole are original;
  the descriptions also abound with details highly interesting to the
  scientific world, for which indeed the learned author principally
  intended it; nevertheless it is a question, whether science in the end
  would not have been equally, and perhaps more advanced, had this work
  been more adapted to general readers. Instruction in these days of
  refinement must be made easy, palatable, and enticing; the eye must be
  pleased, while the understanding is improved, and Wisdom in her simple
  dignified garb will often be deserted for Ignorance, decked out in the
  glittering trappings of Folly.</p>

  <p>The <i>Naturalist's Miscellany</i> conducted by Dr. Shaw, in its
  miscellaneous nature also resembled the present work, and reached to the
  extent of twenty-four volumes. What an invaluable fund of information
  these might have contained had their contents been original!
  Unfortunately, however, the exceptions are so few, that the whole may be
  termed a loose compilation, the descriptions being mostly given in as few
  words as possible, and the figures not only copied from wretched
  representations found in old authors, but often coloured from their
  descriptions only! It is indeed lamentable that the Author, whose talents
  and abilities were unquestionable, should have exerted them so little,
  and thus have descended to the rank of a voluminous compiler, for little
  better can be said of the General Zoology, begun and continued under his
  name: little original matter can there be found, excepting in the latter
  volumes, yet even in these no notice whatever is taken of the immense
  number of new species discovered in Africa by Le Vaillant, and long ago
  published in the <i>Oiseaux d'Afrique</i>: the engravings also are in
  like manner copied from old prints, enlarged or diminished as occasion
  offers, without even a regard to the selection of the best. It may be as
  well to observe in this place, that a great number of generic
  distinctions have been made in the two last volumes; which, as they have
  not been followed by any of the great and acknowledged Zoologists on the
  Continent, and appear to us in many instances trivial and unnecessary,
  will not be adopted in this work.</p>

  <p>It will be unnecessary to point out with regard to the scientific
  arrangement, that we have avowedly adopted the principles of the modern
  classification; which the strict followers of Linnæus (in this country
  alone) have so long, but so ineffectually opposed. The first has been
  designated as the natural, and the other the artificial system; and,
  without entering into a critical disquisition on these definitions, it
  will be sufficient to observe, that by the Artificial System we bend
  nature to conform to certain arbitrary principles, which we lay down and
  to which we insist all her productions known and unknown will conform;
  while in the Natural method, we endeavour by tracing her modifications,
  to adapt our system to that which appears to regulate her operations. In
  the one we give laws, in the other receive them; by the first we are
  taught to believe that the highest attainment of the science, is that of
  ascertaining the name of an object in our Museum, or of giving a new one;
  we record it in our favourite system as a grammarian enters a new word in
  his dictionary, and there the matter terminates. Where the artificial
  system ends, the natural begins; for we then proceed to the investigation
  of affinities founded on anatomical construction, economy, and geographic
  distribution; our attention ceases to be confined to individuals, and
  extends to large groups; general facts enable us to draw general
  conclusions, till the mind begins faintly to discern a vast and mighty
  plan, by which the zones of the earth are peopled by their own respective
  races of animate beings; blending their confines unto each other with
  divine harmony, beauty, and usefulness.</p>

  <p>That these inquiries and results have had a most wonderful effect on
  the natural sciences of late years, is abundantly evident. Geology, a
  subject hardly thought of in this country a few years ago, is now found
  to be a science of the first importance; with this, however, Conchology
  is so intimately connected, that without a certain knowledge of it, the
  geologist is frequently unable to prosecute inquiries of the most
  interesting nature; and there is little doubt but that Botany has been
  raised to the rank it now so justly holds, solely because its natural
  system has been more generally studied and advocated in this country,
  than that of any other branch of Natural History. In this science at
  least, we possess a superiority which our continental neighbours cannot
  dispute; and the name of Brown will be enrolled in the brightest page of
  our philosophic inquirers.</p>

  <p>That the prejudiced adherence to the strict Linnæan system, has been
  the primary cause why Zoology has been more neglected with us than on the
  Continent, will admit of little doubt; for by shutting the door to all
  further improvement, it has impressed the generality of our countrymen
  with an idea, that the highest object of the Naturalist was to label the
  contents of a museum, and to arrange stuffed animals, like quaint
  patterns of old china, in glass cases: to thinking minds no less than to
  the vulgar, this idea has produced a feeling of contempt and ridicule,
  and very few of those qualified by nature for accurate investigation and
  philosophic reasoning, have been induced to make the science a study; and
  thus from such an unfortunate prejudice, to use the words of a powerful
  writer of the present day, "some future historian of the progress of
  human knowledge, will have to state that England, till within the few
  last years, stood still at the bottom of the steps where Linnæus had left
  her; while her neighbours were advancing rapidly towards the entrance of
  the temple<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>."</p>

  <p>Finally&mdash;Linnæus to a comprehensive genius united indefatigable
  industry; yet he could not see and study those innumerable productions
  that have been discovered since his death: in proportion as our knowledge
  of objects increases, so must our systems change, until the natural one
  is fully developed; and the question simply comes to this, Whether the
  Linnæan method should be upheld as a solitary exception to the mutability
  of human wisdom.</p>

  <p>The sun of truth must however finally prevail, and there is every
  reason to think it has already broke, and will gradually disperse these
  mists of prejudice. It is however much to be regretted, that our public
  institutions are wholly inadequate to facilitate not only the advancement
  of students, but the researches of those who are already engaged in
  prosecuting their inquiries: in Scotland alone are founded any
  Professorships of Natural History, and the establishment of our National
  Museum (in this branch only) is confessedly difficult: materials for
  study are more necessary in this science than any other; yet the public
  Institutions and libraries of the metropolis, "rich and rare" in every
  other department of knowledge, in most instances are deficient in this of
  the most elementary books; setting aside those of illustration, which,
  from being unavoidably expensive and within the reach of few purchasers,
  are more particularly adapted for such general repositories of learning.
  The protracted ill-health of its noble possessor, was the cause no doubt
  of the Banksian magnificent library being left deficient in several of
  the latest continental works; and that of the British Museum I have
  reason to think is still more defective. To the honour however of the
  keepers of the Bodleian and Radcliffe Libraries, it should be mentioned,
  that no pains or expense have been spared to render them as perfect in
  this branch as possible; and we have been told that the latter
  particularly is the most magnificent in the kingdom.</p>

  <p>We shall now as briefly as possible advert to the contents of this
  volume.</p>

  <p>In the Ornithological department the systems of Cuvier and Temminck
  have mostly superseded all others: as a whole, we give a decided
  preference to the latter, as being more natural, though it may be doubted
  if the generic distinctions are not too few, while those of Cuvier are
  too many: both however can be considered only as sketches, subject to
  improvement&mdash;as natural affinities are more studied.</p>

  <p>Regarding that part of our work which relates to Entomology, we have
  given a decided preference to the Lepidoptera, for the simple reason that
  this order has received less attention from all writers, concerning their
  real characters and affinities, than any other; indeed they have been
  most unaccountably neglected even by Latreille, the great founder of the
  modern school: we have therefore thought it necessary to propose in this
  department many new genera, and only have to regret that their
  definitions could not be made more perfect without the destruction of the
  specimens, frequently not our own, and which therefore was unattainable:
  a more extended knowledge of the natural affinities existing in this
  tribe, will alone confirm or annul the propriety of these
  distinctions.</p>

  <p>In <i>Conchology</i> many of the genera long established on the
  Continent, but new to our own collectors, have been characterized and
  illustrated, as well as specific distinctions defined between shells
  hitherto considered as varieties; and here it must be observed that so
  much latitude has been given to the meaning of the term <i>variety</i>,
  that in its general acceptation its definition becomes impossible: our
  own idea of its true meaning is, a shell possessing one or more
  characters which are changeable and uncertain, and which consequently
  will not serve as indications by which it may infallibly be distinguished
  from all others; <i>variety</i> depends on local circumstances, and
  affects the size, colour, and greater or less development of the same
  modification of structure; a <i>species</i> is permanent, its structure
  always the same though more or less developed, producing and perpetuating
  its kind, and depending on formation, discernible in youth, and matured
  in age: we cannot therefore comprehend the contradictory term of
  <i>permanent varieties</i> in a state of nature (though such occur in
  domesticated animals), which some authors have used, and which has led
  to, in many instances, the most erroneous conclusions.</p>

  <p>It is lamentable to see the opposition which is still made by our own
  writers against all the modern improvements; yet although Linnæan
  Introductions to Conchology are constantly issuing from the press, the
  desire of being acquainted with a more natural and intelligible
  classification has already appeared; and as we are frequently questioned
  on the subject, we cannot in this place do better than refer the young
  student to the valuable article on Conchology contained in the late
  supplement to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, the perusal of which
  will convey more solid information, and less perplexity, than all the
  Introductions our booksellers can boast of.</p>

  <p>With respect to the quotations or synonyms, it should be observed that
  we have in most instances limited them only to original works, all
  doubtful ones have been rejected, and such only given as have been
  actually consulted; indeed to this latter cause must be attributed the
  occasional omission of some, existing in books we had not the immediate
  power of consulting; our own library is not small; but the difficulty and
  expense of procuring all the new continental publications, and the
  impossibility of meeting with them at our public libraries<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, may have sometimes led us into error,
  and unintentionally to have passed over the discoveries of others.</p>

  <p>With the few additions contained in the Appendix we shall now
  conclude; trusting that in the remarks drawn from us by the present state
  of the science in this country, our zeal for truth will not give us an
  appearance of want of candour or of vanity. The truth of our remarks on
  the labours of others, every one at all acquainted with the subject can
  inquire into, and either acknowledge or disprove: we neither deprecate
  nor despise criticism: an author who presumes to instruct others, should
  have his pretensions publicly canvassed, his merits admitted, or his
  deficiency exposed; no one is more sensible than we are that our own
  pretensions chiefly consist in having set an example for others more able
  to follow: and if we have in any way advocated the cause of truth and
  science, our object will be attained, and we shall then gladly retire in
  the shade.</p>

  <p>We only thoroughly identified this beautiful little bird, by an
  inspection of the costly work of Le Vaillant on this family, in the
  Banksian Library: for the description of the orange-winged Parakeet of
  Dr. Latham is not applicable; and Dr. Shaw has persisted in the old error
  of considering this species a variety of the Toui Parakeet, although the
  question had been put at rest by the original description and sound
  reasons of Le Vaillant. There is a wide difference between naturalists
  who compile, and form their theories from books, and those who study
  nature, and think for themselves; and nothing will result from the first
  but mischief to the science, and perplexity to the student.</p>

  <p>Our figure is from a specimen brought from Demerara by C. Edmonston,
  Esq.; another is in the possession of A. MacLeay, Esq. Though rare in our
  cabinets, M. Le Vaillant says it is common in Cayenne. He has given a
  beautiful figure of the female, which is entirely green.</p>

  <p>Total length six inches. Plumage above entirely green, beneath paler
  and inclining to yellow; just under the lower mandible is a small
  snuff-coloured spot, and a very narrow line of the same in front just
  above the nostrils; the quills dark-green, the greater ones on their
  outside base are blue, with which the head is also tinged. The spurious
  wings are entirely of a rich and clear orange. Inner wing-covers green.
  Quills inside greenish-blue, except on each side the shafts, where there
  is a line of black. Tail short, cuneated, hardly projecting an inch
  beyond the wings, both above and below green: the interior margin
  dirty-yellow, the feathers pointed. Bill and legs flesh-colour.</p>

  <p>The present species is one of the many interesting birds collected in
  Java by my friend Dr. Horsfield: it was not, however, until I had
  described and engraved another specimen, sent to Sir J. Banks from
  Ceylon, that I discovered the species had already been included in the
  Doctor's account of the birds of Java, presented to the Linnæan Society,
  where he has described it under the name of <i>Orthorynchus
  frontalis</i>.</p>

  <p>The specific name of its first describer is of course retained: with
  respect, however, to its generic situation, I must be allowed to dissent
  from considering it as a distinct genus, merely from the prolongation of
  the hinder toe being somewhat more developed than in <i>Sitta Europæa</i>
  and <i>Carolinensis</i>, both which birds are now before me, and which in
  themselves differ in the relative proportion of this part: thus in <i>S.
  Carolinensis</i> the hind toe and claw is two-tenths of an inch shorter
  than the leg; in <i>S. Europæa</i> it is one-tenth shorter; and in the
  present species it just exceeds that of the leg: in every other respect
  not the slightest difference I apprehend will be observed <span
  class="correction" title="Original read 'as the foregoing generic character has been drawn up from these three species', see Addenda et Corrigenda"

  <p>Total length five inches. Size of the European Nuthatch. Bill, from
  the angle of the mouth to the tip, eight lines; front of the head
  velvet-black, continued in a stripe of the same colour over the eye, and
  terminating above the ear feathers: the upper plumage is of a rich blue,
  more brilliant on the head, and paler on the front, and external margins
  of the quills. Spurious wings and lesser quills black margined with blue.
  Inner wing-covers deep black; the under plumage is a light-brown,
  changing to lilac on the ears and sides of the neck, and tinged with
  cinereous on the flanks and vent: the chin is white; tail even, the two
  middle feathers blue, the rest more or less black, having the external
  margins and tips blue. The outer quill of the wings is short, the second
  and third longest and equal, the fourth rather less; the hind toe with
  the claw, measures one inch in a straight line.</p>

  <p>This unique and beautiful Mitre has been already described by Captain
  Marryat in the Linnæan Transactions: the figures, however, are
  uncoloured, and give a very indifferent idea of the graceful symmetry of
  its form. My friend Dr. Leach, with his usual liberality, permitted me to
  draw the accompanying figure of it at the British Museum, where it is now
  deposited.</p>

  <p>It appears to have been taken near Nice in the Mediterranean, adhering
  to a sounding-line, in very deep water; a very singular locality, since
  nearly all the Mitres have generally been supposed to inhabit the
  tropical seas, or at least far from the coasts of Europe. It should,
  however, be remarked, that <i>Cypræa lurida</i>, an Asiatic shell, I have
  found on the shores of Greece: and C. Ulysses, in his travels in the
  kingdom of Naples, enumerates several shells as inhabiting the warm
  shores of the Tarentine Bay, which are generally known only as natives of
  the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. These facts, with many others, prove the
  physical distribution of <i>Molluscæ</i> to be less decidedly marked than
  almost any other class of animals.</p>

  <p>This genus is included with that of <i>Voluta</i> by Linnæus and our
  own writers, although long ago justly separated by the continental
  zoologists.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Bulimus</i> was long ago formed by Scopoli out of the
  heterogeneous mixture of shells thrown together in the Linnæan genus
  <i>Helix</i><a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, &amp;c.: it
  comprehends some of the larger and most beautiful of the exotic land
  shells, among which the present species will stand conspicuous both in
  beauty of colouring and excessive rarity. While travelling among the
  forests of Brazil, in the province of Bahia, I found the shell here
  figured one morning on the leaves of a <i>Solanum</i>. I not only
  searched myself, but promised as a reward to any of my Indians who would
  bring me another, a two-bladed Birmingham knife!&mdash;the greatest
  temptation they could have!&mdash;but in vain; for I never saw another
  before or since.</p>

  <p>There are many peculiar characters presented in this species
  independent of its colour: the spiral whorls are strongly plaited
  longitudinally about half their length, and marked very slightly (but
  sufficiently distinct) with several oblique indented striæ; the principal
  whorl has a row of indented and unequal sulcations near the suture, and a
  slight appearance of elevation along the white transverse band; the outer
  lip is thick, broad, and flattened beneath; but the margin is reflected
  back, and forms a prominent rim on the upper surface. The shell, when
  viewed closely, appears rough with minute scale-like elevations, very
  much resembling shagreen.</p>

<h5><img src="images/separator.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex;" alt="" /></h5>

  <p>The present insect is selected to illustrate a very elegant family of
  Butterflies, whose predominant tints are composed of orange, yellow, and
  white, variously blended and disposed in a greater or less degree
  throughout all the species. The generic characters above given will
  distinguish them as peculiar to the tropics, and principally those of
  South America; one or two species only being found in Africa, and five or
  six inhabiting India.</p>

  <p>I have no doubt this is the <i>Pap. Statira</i> of Cramer; it is found
  only in Brazil, and has been erroneously considered by Godart and
  Latreille as a variety of <i>C. Jugurthina</i>, an Indian insect, and
  which in fact is not in itself a species, being no other than the female
  of <i>C. Alcmeone</i>, as an attentive examination of a vast number of
  both, collected in Java by Dr. Horsfield, enabled me to ascertain.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary prolongation of the last joint of the palpi, and the
  white borderless spots beneath, which are never silvered, will
  distinguish this species through all the variations; in the ground colour
  of its wings, which in no two specimens are exactly alike, and one before
  me is nearly white; the lesser snowy dot is sometimes very obscure, and
  often wanting; but the prolongation of the palpi is even expressed in
  Cramer's figure above quoted.</p>

  <p>I have examined about a dozen specimens, mostly captured by myself,
  and all have been females; and I strongly suspect future and more decided
  observations will prove <i>C. Evadne</i> to be the other sex: it has the
  palpi lengthened, though in a less degree; and the articulations of the
  antennæ in both insects will be found somewhat thickened at their
  termination when viewed under a magnifier, a peculiarity I have seen in
  no other species; and although I have examined near thirty specimens of
  <i>C. Evadne</i>, they have invariably proved to be males.</p>

  <p>The palpi in this insect will be found at variance with the generic
  character now given; a striking proof that in a natural system no single
  part can be taken as an unerring criterion for generic distinction,
  without making it eventually an artificial one. The <i>Colias Drya</i> of
  Fabricius has the same formation of palpi, but is a totally different
  insect.</p>

  <p>In size this insect is the largest of the genus yet discovered; it was
  first noticed by Godart, who has given it the name of my learned and
  valued friend, Dr. W. E. Leach, of the British Museum, whose talents are
  too well known to need any eulogium in this place.</p>

  <p>It appears to inhabit both the northern and southern extremities of
  Brazil; for I have seen it in a box sent from Parà, and my specimens were
  captured in Minas Geraes by my friend Dr. Langsdorff. It is, however, a
  rare species; for I have only seen seven or eight specimens, and they
  were all males: the female, when found, will probably differ as
  remarkably as in most of this genus.</p>

  <p>The opaque spot on the inferior wings above is very large; but the
  tuft of hair corresponding beneath the superior wings, is entirely
  wanting. It should be likewise observed, that although this insect in
  every outward respect resembles a genuine <i>Colias</i> (the type of
  which may be <i>C. Ebule</i>), it differs very materially in the terminal
  appendages of the abdomen; the last joint being the shortest, and
  scarcely pointed; and the hook, instead of being concealed beneath this
  segment, is exserted beyond it, and met by two others, one at the base of
  each lateral valve: these valves are also much shorter, ovate, and not
  attenuated, although ending in an incurved hook. In the present ignorance
  in which a true knowledge of the Lepidoptera is involved, it is
  impossible to say how far these dissimilarities may point out natural
  groups; it is therefore of the highest importance to the science such
  facts should be noticed.</p>

  <p>A richly coloured little bird, much smaller than our Goldfinch, and
  approaching very near to the <i>Bouvreuil de Bourbon</i> of Buffon, from
  which, however, I think it quite distinct. The only one I have yet seen
  is in the possession of E. Falkner, Esq. of Fairfield near Liverpool, who
  received it with a few other rare birds from the Spanish Main.</p>

  <p>Total length four inches. Bill blackish and very sharp. The whole head
  and forepart of the neck is black. The plumage of the body is a fine
  reddish-orange, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'dulleron', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >duller on</span> the back and brightest beneath: wing-covers the same;
  the greater ones at their base black, which forms a bar: the quills are
  also black, the greater ones having at their base an oblique bar of
  orange, and some of the lesser ones slightly margined externally with
  white. Tail divaricated and black; some of the lateral feathers faintly
  margined with orange. Spurious wings black. Legs and claws brown.</p>

  <p>The <i>Bouvreuil de Bourbon</i>, and the <i>B. du Cap de Bonne
  Esperance</i> of Buffon (<i>Pl. Enl. pl.</i> 204. <i>fig.</i> 1, 2.)
  appear to have been described as the different sexes of one bird (the
  Orange Grossbeak of Latham) on mere conjecture. I think them quite
  distinct, inhabiting different countries, and having all the appearance
  (in the figures) of being two male birds; for the females in this family
  seldom possess the rich colours of the male; and the figure of the last
  of these birds, has not the slightest habit of a female.</p>

  <p>The present genus was formed by Cuvier, (though but very slightly
  defined,) and includes the common Goldfinch and Canary-bird.</p>

  <p>The true Bee-eaters are confined to the old world, principally
  inhabiting Africa and Asia; one species only, the European Bee-eater,
  being known with any degree of certainty to be found in Europe; and this
  is occasionally seen in England. They are all gregarious, feeding on the
  wing, and in general migratory.</p>

  <p>Most unwillingly I have again in this instance anticipated my friend
  Dr. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Horsfeild', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Horsfield</span> in describing this bird, which he found in Java, and
  which I engraved after one sent from Ceylon, without knowing it had also
  fallen under his observation.</p>

  <p>The figure is less than the natural size, which is nearly that of our
  European species. Bill an inch and a half long from the gape, and black.
  Nostrils small, basal, round, not sulcated, partially defended by
  incumbent hairs; at the angle of the mouth is a row of short, stiff
  bristles; a black line commences from the nostrils, passes under the eye,
  and terminates with the ears. The upper part of the head, neck, and
  between the wings, rufous. The rump and upper tail-covers pale blue: the
  chin and throat sulphur tinged with rufous, where an irregular and narrow
  collar of black crosses the neck. The remaining under parts
  yellowish-green. Wings and quills fulvous green, the latter tipt with
  black, and all the inner shafts more or less rufous: the second quill
  longest, and the lesser quills and tail-feathers notched at their tips.
  Tail green, slightly forked; the tips and under side dusky-black, and
  three inches and a half long. Wings, when closed, four inches one line in
  length. Vent blueish-white.</p>

  <p>The females in this genus may generally be distinguished by the two
  middle tail-feathers being but slightly or not at all elongated.</p>

  <p>A shell no less remarkable for its form than its extreme rarity. The

  specimen known in this country is the one here figured, from the cabinet
  of Ch. Dubois, Esq., who obligingly favoured me with it for examination;
  neither does the exquisite work on the Land Shells, by M. de Ferrusac,
  now publishing at Paris, contain this species among the numerous
  matchless figures already given of this family.</p>

  <p>In the present uncertainty respecting the natural groups of the genus
  <i>Helix</i>, as left by Lamarck, I have preferred for the present
  following the example of Cuvier and de Ferrusac, in placing it with that
  family, in preference to adopting the ill-defined and palpably artificial
  distribution of them by D. de Montfort, or of forming a new genus for its
  reception.</p>

  <p>The variegations in its colouring are better seen in the figures than
  described. The whole shell is slightly marked with obsolete longitudinal
  striæ; the umbilicus is very deep, and the tooth does not extend
  externally beyond the margin of the lip.</p>

  <p>A pretty and diminutive species, scarcely ever more than one inch
  three lines long. The spire long in proportion, and occupying half an
  inch: when in perfection the colour is a deep chesnut, minutely broken
  into finely serrated darker lines, with one, two, or three interrupted
  bands of white on the body whorl, the spire, and margin of the outer lip
  paler; there are two or three nodules above; and the spiral volutions
  have the carinated row of tubercles usual in the <i>Strombi</i>, and are
  besides finely striated transversely. The base of the shell is more
  deeply and distinctly striated; both the lips are much thickened, tumid,
  white, and highly polished; terminating above in obtuse points on the
  second spiral whorl, leaving a narrow ascending channel between; the
  inside of the aperture is a fine yellow.</p>

  <p>Inhabits the Indian seas, but is not common.</p>

  <p>By some unaccountable oversight, Mr. Dillwyn has very well described
  this shell, but under the name and supposition of its being the <i>S.
  marginatus</i> of Linnæus; though a few pages after he brings all the
  true synonyms referring to his shell, under a description purporting to
  be that of <i>S. minimus</i>, but which in reality is more applicable to
  our next species. Why this writer should doubt the correctness of Gmelin,
  Chemnitz, &amp;c. respecting the true <i>S. marginatus</i> of Linnæus,
  does not appear, particularly as he has substituted for it a well known
  species. I have little doubt myself they all mean one and the same shell,
  which is nothing more than a scarce variety of <i>S. accinctus</i>, now
  before me, with which Linnæus's original description pretty well
  agrees.</p>

  but is easily distinguished by being in general much larger, by having
  the inner lip not at all thickened above, the outer lip very slightly
  lobed, and only advancing on the first volution of the spire: it varies,
  however, amazingly in colour. There is a small variety, having a brown

  <p>This new and elegant insect was discovered by my worthy friend Dr.
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Horsfeild', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Horsfield</span> (after whom I have named it) in the interior of Java:
  it forms a part of the extensive collections made there by this zealous
  naturalist for the East India Company, and which will make a most
  important addition to our present confined knowledge of the productions
  of that interesting island: indeed these collections exceed in extent,
  preservation, and value, any which have been brought to this country.</p>

  <p>The general resemblance of this species with <i>Papilio Jairus</i> of
  Fabricius is so great, that it might pass on a cursory view as a mere
  variety, did not the form of the anterior wings at once point out the
  difference. In the present insect the posterior and exterior margins are
  of equal length, giving a narrow appearance to the wings, much resembling
  some of the true <i>Papilionidæ</i>; but in <i>P. Jairus</i>, these wings
  are much broader, more obtuse, and the length of the posterior margin
  much greater; other minor differences exist in the colouring and
  markings. My valued friend A. H. Haworth, Esq., F.L.S., &amp;c. possesses
  a fine pair of the true <i>P. Jairus</i> in his rich and extensive
  collection; and the liberality with which it is constantly and freely
  opened to me, deserves my warmest thanks.</p>

  <p>From these two species I have formed the present genus, the characters
  of which will distinguish it from that of <i>Hætera</i> (Fabr.), a scanty
  genus confined to South America; and this seems to occupy its place in
  India: both will come in the natural family of <i><span

  >Horsfield</span>'s collections; I could not therefore dissect the mouth,
  &amp;c. On the inner borders of the inferior wings is a lengthened tuft
  of fine hairs: the <i>anus</i> beneath has on each side an obtuse

  <p><i>P. olivaceus, subtùs flavus; capite mentoque cinereis.</i></p>

  <p>Olivaceous Flat-bill, beneath yellow. Head and chin cinereous.</p>

<h5><img src="images/separator.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex;" alt="" /></h5>

  <p>The sober tints of this little bird accord more with those of Europe
  than of India, of which country however it is a native, having been sent
  from Ceylon to the British Museum: it is the only one I have yet seen,
  and appears hitherto undescribed.</p>

  <p>The stiff bristles at the corner of the mouth are nearly the length of
  the bill, which is quite flattened: the tail is even, and the whole bird
  in every respect but colour closely resembles the bearded Flycatcher
  (<i>Musc. barbata</i> Lath.).</p>

  <p>Cuvier and other modern zoologists have done much in distributing the
  Linnæan <i>Muscicapæ</i> into their natural families; but as we are
  acquainted with a great number from descriptions only, the arrangement is
  by no means perfect.</p>

  <p>The generic characters now given of the genus <i>Platyrhynchos</i>
  (very slightly noticed by Vieillot) will be found perfectly applicable to
  the separate divisions here formed; the first comprising the <i>Todus
  Platyrhynchos</i> of Gmelin, and a few others having the bill larger and
  more dilated than the second division, which includes the present
  species, together with <i>M. barbata</i>, <i>cærulea</i>, <i>cuneata</i>,
  and no doubt many others. The construction of the bill in all these birds
  will be found precisely the same, though more or less developed in each
  division, and even in the species; it thus becomes impossible to draw the
  line of demarcation without refining too much on generic distinctions.
  Their bills, although so broad, are by no means stout; thus enabling them
  to prey with greater readiness on the <i>Lepidoptera</i> and other large
  winged insects with soft bodies; while the long stiff bristles at the
  base of the bill seem intended to confine the resistance their prey would
  otherwise make by their wings. The illustrious Cuvier has well observed,
  that the true Flycatchers have the bill longer, narrowed, less
  compressed, and the tip but slightly bent.</p>

  <p>The Woodpeckers form a most natural family of birds, and are dispersed
  in every part of the known world, excepting the Polar regions. Eight
  species inhabit Europe, five of which are found in our own country. The
  largest however of these, the Great Black Woodpecker, is very rare; and
  even the others are less frequently seen than formerly, from the gradual
  diminution of our few remaining forests.</p>

  <p>The present appears an undescribed species, and was sent from the
  Spanish Main to E. Falkner, Esq. of Fairfield. I have since seen the
  male, which, like many others of this genus, is distinguished by a patch
  of red below the eye.</p>

  <p>Total length, eight inches and a half; bill one inch long, blackish;
  front and crown cinereous black; the hind head and nape crimson; a dusky
  whitish line (beginning at the nostrils) includes the eye and
  ear-feathers; below this on each side blackish, with longitudinal whitish
  dots, which in the male is mixed near the bill with crimson; chin
  blackish, speckled with white. The general plumage above is uniform tawny
  rufous brown, becoming more olive on the rump. Under parts olivaceous
  yellow, crossed with numerous close bands of blackish brown. Quills with
  the inner web black, the margin pale yellow; shafts and outer web tawny;
  tail the same, the shafts and outer half black, excepting the last pair,
  which have yellowish shafts and dusky tips. Wings inside, pale orange.
  Legs and claws dusky green.</p>

  <p>Two or three other individuals have since fallen under my observation:
  the male I saw at Mr. Leadbeater's, Animal Preserver, in Brewer-street,
  of whose liberality and integrity in every way, I can bear the most
  unqualified and cheerful testimony.</p>

  <p>The resplendent and changeable azure blue which ornaments the body and
  part of the wings in this very singular insect, can be but ill expressed
  in the figure. It is one of the many new and interesting subjects in
  entomology discovered in Java by Dr. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Horsfeild', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Horsfield</span>; and by his kindness and liberality I am enabled to add
  the figures of the caterpillar and chrysalis, which were copied out of a
  fine series of drawings made in Java under his own eye: they do not
  appear to differ in their formation from others of this family, although
  the perfect insect possesses such striking and peculiar generic
  characters; one of the many facts which prove the impossibility of making
  the <i>Larvæ</i> a primary consideration in forming the genera of
  Lepidoptera.</p>

  <p>This is a rare insect, I have therefore been obliged to leave the
  generic character imperfect, as the dissection of the mouth, &amp;c.
  would destroy the specimen. The posterior margin in the wings of the male
  is sinuated; in the female it is nearly straight; the underside of the
  wings in both sexes is the same; the anterior pair reddish-brown, paler
  in the middle; the tip and posterior margin whitish: inferior wings
  reddish-orange towards the inner margin, with an obsolete central curved
  band of the same, and a black dot at the base of the inferior wings. The
  head, palpi, and thorax are margined with orange, less conspicuous in the
  female.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the genus <i>Hesperia</i> of Latreille (under which
  the present insect would come) is little more than what was known of
  <i>Scarabæus</i> twenty years ago; nor has Fabricius even noticed one
  half of the species figured by Cramer. The larva feeds on</p>

  <p>The Tinamous are entirely confined to the new world, where they seem
  to hold the same scale in creation which the Partridges do in the old
  continent. Our knowledge of these singular birds has been much increased
  by the writings of Professor Temminck, who has described twelve species.
  The present bird is nearly the smallest of its family: I found it only
  once in the interior of Bahia in Brazil, where it must be very rare, or
  frequent to particular districts only. Though differing in some respects
  from the description of Temminck, I am inclined to consider it merely as
  a variety.</p>

  the edges of the wing-covers tinged with pale cinereous; the spurious

  mark of the same kind; those on the vent are similarly marked, but on a
  pale rufous ground; the thighs are rufous-white; the under tail-covers
  rufous, marked by narrow undulated concentric lines of black, the ends

  <p>A new species of this already extensive family, inhabiting the
  interior of Brazil in the province of Bahia, where I met with it but
  once. It was, I believe, first described in a paper I sent to the
  Wernerian Society some time ago: the figure is less than the natural
  size.</p>

  <p>Total length nine inches. Bill not quite an inch, and blackish. Irides
  yellow. Head slightly crested; the whole upper part crimson. Orbits and
  cheeks olive-brown; beneath this a narrow line of tawny-yellow begins at
  the nostrils and passes down the sides of the neck; next this is a
  similar stripe crimson on the jaws and olive beyond, leaving the chin and
  throat in front yellowish; the plumage above is tawny-olive. Quills
  black, within edged with rufous: all the under parts tawny-yellow,
  transversely banded with blackish lines; inner wing-covers yellowish.
  Tail three inches and a half long, the feathers black, unspotted, and
  tinged at their base with olive. Feet and claws lead-colour. The neck is
  very slender. The only one I have yet seen was a male.</p>

  <p>The birds of this genus are remarkable for the enormous width of their
  mouths, which in some species exceeds that of the Swallow family, thus
  enabling them with ease to swallow the large berries of the
  <i>Melastomæ</i> and other tropical shrubs, on which they alone subsist;
  not on insects, as Cuvier asserts. Although in the construction of their
  bills they perfectly resemble the Swallows, their wings are not formed
  for long or rapid flight; and their feet are much stronger, and
  calculated for searching among branches for their food, in which
  situations I have frequently seen them. The term "<i>pedes
  ambulatorii</i>," or walking-feet, is applied too generally, and should
  be confined to the gallinaceous and Pigeon tribes.</p>

  <p>This genus was formed by Count Hoffmansegg, and the present is the
  smallest species known: our figure is of the male bird. Total length
  about five inches and a half. The bill from the angle to the tip measures
  seven lines; but from the nostrils only three lines and a half. The
  middle of the body, vent, and under tail-covers in the male are pure
  white; in the female yellowish, with a line of olive-green down the
  middle of each shaft; the quills, wing-covers, and tail-feathers are
  black, margined in the male with blue, and in the female with green: the
  tail is slightly forked. The nostrils round and bare; the base of the
  bill has a few weak setaceous hairs. The legs resemble the true
  Chatterers, having the outer toe rather longer than the inner, and
  attached to the base of the middle.</p>

  <p>This is a scarce bird, apparently not hitherto described; I met with
  it only three times in Bahia; but it appears more frequent in the
  southern provinces of Brazil, specimens having been sent me from Minas
  Geralis and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

  <p>This is one of the smallest of Butterflies, and from the extreme
  delicacy of its form seems to sanction with truth the poetic idea of
  living "but for a day." It is found in Brazil, inhabiting only the
  deepest forests, as if fearful its little life would be endangered by the
  scorching rays of a tropical sun: in these sombre shades it is seen to
  fly slowly and feebly near those spots where a ray of the sun has
  partially entered the thick canopy of foliage above, which is frequently
  fifty or sixty feet from the ground.</p>

  <p>The genus I have now placed it in belongs to the <i>Coliadæ</i>, and
  appears to connect that family with the <i>Pieridæ</i>: their
  distinctions are obviously marked and very constant in all the species I
  have yet seen, and which are tropical: of these, seven I discovered in
  Brazil; three or four more are natives of the southern extremity of North
  America; and Dr. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Horsfeild', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Horsfield</span> has four or five from Java. I know of none from Africa.
  Their size in general is very small.</p>

  <p>I think this species is the <i>Pieris Elvina</i> of Godart; although
  the insect he mentions as the female is in reality that of his <i>Pieris
  Neda</i>. The true female I have never seen; I suspect it will want the
  gibbous curve on the hinder wings of the male, which sex is, indeed, not
  common, and is generally much smaller, and sometimes half the size only,
  of the figure.</p>

  <p><i>Papilio Nicippe</i> of Cramer (tab. 210. fig. C. D.) strictly
  belongs to this genus, though placed in that of <i>Colias</i> by Godart,
  as well as his <i>Pieris Agave</i>, <i>Hecabe</i>, and doubtless many
  others not now before me.</p>

  <p>This superb shell is figured from a matchless specimen brought home by
  that illustrious and lamented patron of science, the late Sir J. Banks,
  from the Pacific Ocean: it is now, together with his entire collection of
  shells and insects, in the Museum of the Linnæan Society.</p>

  <p>It is of great rarity, and the present specimen far exceeds in size
  any I have yet seen. A very perfect one exists in my father's collection
  which measures only two inches one line long: it differs slightly in
  wanting the lower white band and its inferior border: there is also an
  additional small plait between the second and third, a variation not
  uncommon in the Linnæan Volutes, and which lessens the importance of this
  character as a specific distinction.</p>

  <p>It is unfigured, and I believe undescribed, unless perhaps in
  Solander's MSS. In its small state it may have been overlooked as one of
  the numerous varieties of <i>M. vulpecula</i>; but the sharp angulated
  plaitings, the cancellated base, and the numerous faintly-grooved lines
  on the spire, as well as the more slender and lengthened form, will at
  once distinguish it: its colours also are very striking and
  dissimilar.</p>

  <p>Another new and very rare bird of this singular genus, inhabiting,
  like all the other species, the tropical regions of America. I met with

  which part the bill is not so proportionably broad as in the Swallow
  Berryeater (<a href="#Plate21">pl. 21.</a>): the colour blueish-black,
  paler at the base: the whole head, sides, chin, and part of the throat
  are black, the feathers of the crown a little lengthened and pointed,
  giving a slight appearance of a crest: the wings and tail are dusky-black
  on the inner shafts and green on the outer; the whole of the upper
  plumage olive-green, and of the under pale greenish-yellow crossed with
  short dusky transverse lines from the breast downwards; under wing and
  tail-covers the same. Tail four inches from the base, slightly
  divaricated, and of twelve feathers. Wings four inches and a half, the

  <p>The Kingsfishers have such a general similarity of form, that the most
  casual observer is able to distinguish them: a very long straight bill,
  short wings, and (in general) a shorter tail with very small legs, are
  the prominent distinctions of such as are usually seen; and the richness
  of plumage that generally pervades them cannot be better exemplified than
  in our own beautiful species, the common Kingsfisher, not unfrequent in
  many parts of England.</p>

  <p>These birds, hitherto placed in systems under one genus, nevertheless
  contain two distinct groups differing materially in the construction of
  that primary organ of supporting life, the bill; and in their physical
  distribution, or the countries they respectively inhabit, two most
  important considerations in the natural arrangement of animals under the
  present elevated views of the philosophic zoologist, with whom the study
  of Nature consists no longer in the study of words, the retention of
  names, or even the accurate description of species.</p>

  <p>These considerations have induced me to form these birds into two
  genera, the definitions of which are now given: those retained under the
  old genus of <i>Alcedo</i> appear to be scattered (though sparingly) in
  every part of the old and the new world. Their bills seem formed for
  swallowing their food more in an entire state, similar to the Herons. In
  each of these genera one species exists with only three toes, a
  remarkable circumstance, which in an artificial system would endanger
  their being united in a separate genus; but which, from the remarkable
  smallness of the inner toe in all the other species, cannot I apprehend
  point out any peculiarity either in their habit or economy: and this
  opinion I find is likewise entertained by Professor Temminck.</p>

  <p>Total length seven inches and a quarter. Bill from the gape two inches
  one line, the upper mandible rather longest, and both with a slight
  appearance of a notch; the colour black. All the upper plumage, as well
  as the sides of the head, ears, and stripe beyond, fine ultramarine blue,
  more vivid on the rump and tail-covers, and duller on the tail,
  wing-covers, and lesser quill-margins; front blackish; from the nostrils
  to the eye a whitish line, and from the ears on each side the neck a
  whitish stripe, which almost forms a collar round the nape.
  Quill-feathers sooty black. All the under parts orange ferrugineous;
  throat and belly nearly white. Tail very short, nearly hid by the upper
  covers. Feet red, claws black. The inner fore-toe wanting, but a slight
  rudiment of it exists in my specimen.</p>

  <p>Since writing the above, I find this bird is figured and described in
  a beautiful work commenced by Lewin on the birds of New Holland, which
  Mr. Brown, the learned possessor of the Banksian library, pointed out to
  me. I believe but a few copies are known. Lewin observes, "it inhabits
  heads of rivers, visiting dead trees, from the branches of which it darts
  on its prey in the water beneath, and is sometimes completely immersed by
  the velocity of its descent."</p>

  <p>Dr. Latham has very well described it, but quite overlooked the
  construction of the feet.</p>

  <p>Referring to the observations we have already made on Kingsfishers
  generally, it will be only necessary to observe, that the species now
  formed into the genus <i>Halcyon</i> appear entirely excluded from the
  American continent: their bills are much stronger, thicker, and more
  rounded than the genuine Kingsfishers, and the under mandible beneath
  invariably carinated and curving upwards. One of them (the <i>Alcedo
  Senegalensis</i> of Latham) is known to feed on crabs, the breaking and
  disjointing of which this structure seems admirably calculated to
  accomplish; and although some authors mention insects also as their food,
  I apprehend it is only in the absence of other larger prey more suited to
  the construction of their bills.</p>

  <p>Total length eight inches and a half. Bill two inches three lines from
  the gape, and one inch three quarters from the nostrils; upper mandible
  and margin and lip of the lower, black, the rest yellowish-white. The
  general plumage above is pale and changeable greenish-blue, the green
  predominating on the scapulars, head and tail; the upper part of the neck
  is crossed by a white collar, separated from the green of the head by a
  narrow margin of black, which passes on the ear-feathers round the nape;
  a narrow whitish line runs from the nostrils to the eyebrows, and another
  very short one is beneath the eye; the whole of the under plumage white.
  Quills black edged with blue, the second, third and fourth equal and
  longest. Wings four inches and a quarter. Tail even, near three inches
  long, above blue-green, beneath black. Feet dusky; middle and outer claws
  much longer than the leg.</p>

  <p>Inhabits Java and other parts of India, and is I believe unfigured.
  The line at the bottom of the plate is on the scale of an inch.</p>

  <p>Since writing the above, Temminck's new edition of the <i>Manuel
  d'Ornithologie</i> has just reached me, in which I perceive he has
  continued the birds of this genus under that of <i>Alcedo</i>, observing
  that their plumage is always shining, and that he can find no characters
  for their geographic distribution: yet, notwithstanding the opinion of
  this eminent ornithologist, a close attention will I believe prove,
  first, that no species of Linnæan <i>Alcedo</i> bearing the characters of
  <i>Halcyon</i> have yet been discovered as natives of America; and
  secondly, that species of genuine <i>Alcedo</i> will be found with
  plumage quite devoid of any bright or shining colours. One or two exist
  in my own cabinet, but to which I cannot now refer.</p>

  <p>The situation of <i>Halcyon</i> will be between <i>Alcedo</i> and
  <i>Dacelo</i>; from the last of which it is distinguished by its
  perfectly straight, acute, and entire upper mandible, which, on the
  contrary, in <i>Dacelo</i> is notched, the tip bent and obtuse.</p>

  <p>The celebrated Latreille, the father of modern Entomology, has well
  observed, that the immense number of insects crowded together in the
  genus <i>Hesperia</i> contain many natural genera, but which the paucity
  of species generally found in cabinets prevents us from discriminating.
  Having for a long time paid attention to this family, and possessing near
  300 species in my own cabinet, I have had the opportunity of attempting
  their elucidation; and the above generic character is applied to those
  insects only which I propose considering genuine species of the genus
  <i>Hesperia</i>, and which will comprise near 170 species.</p>

  <p>I have named this new, undescribed and very rare insect, in honour of
  my esteemed friend A. H. Haworth, Esq. F.L.S., &amp;c., well known by the
  benefits his writings have conferred on the sister sciences of entomology
  and botany. The only two insects I ever saw of this species I captured in
  the southern part of Brazil.</p>

  appearance to the suture: the transverse striæ slender, and filling up
  the interstices. The spire is nearly smooth and a little bent: the ground
  colour very light orange, with three darker interrupted bands on the

  <p>The largest shells hitherto discovered as inhabiting the dry land
  belong to this genus, instituted by the celebrated Lamarck, but still
  divided by the strict followers of Linnæus between the <i>Bullæ</i> and
  <i>Helices</i>, with a singular infelicity of even artificial
  arrangement. The simple characters peculiar in a greater or less degree
  to all, will readily distinguish them; and I apprehend most of the
  species of the first division (which includes the present) will be found
  to inhabit only the African continent, while <i>Bulla virginea</i> and
  the smaller shells placed in the second division are found principally in
  the new world; where also two or three gigantic species of <i>Bulimus</i>
  occupy the place of the larger African <i>Achatinæ</i>.</p>

  <p>Of these, the shell now figured is one of the rarest, and has hitherto
  been overlooked as a variety of the Linnæan <i>Bulla Achatina</i>; the
  colour of both is subject to much variation; but this will be found at
  best a most indecisive and vague character for specific distinction when
  unaccompanied by others more important and connected with the formation
  of shells. I have therefore not hesitated in making this a distinct
  species, from having had the means of examining at different times near
  twenty specimens, all of which presented the following characters. Spire
  of five whorls, the last or terminal one very small and flattened; the
  apex obtuse; the suture depressed, as if flattened on the shell, and
  margined by one or sometimes two indented lines, parallel, and at the top
  of each whorl. In the colour of its mouth it varies in sometimes having a
  tinge of rose-colour at the base and top of the spire, but the mouth is
  more generally white. The body whorl is more or less ventricose; the
  outer lip is a little reflected, and the whole shell, when full grown,
  much thicker and heavier than any of the other species. The epidermis is
  yellowish-brown, beneath which the shell is nearly white, beautifully
  marked with broad remote stripes of chesnut, with others more slender
  (and sometimes broken into spots) between. I have another specimen which
  agrees tolerably with Lister's figure in being more than usually
  ventricose, and which I think is accidental. The only constant variety
  appears to be that figured by Knorr, ii. tab. 3. fig. 1. having the spire
  entirely rose-colour.</p>

  <p>The marginal line and the correct number of whorls in the spire are
  well expressed in the figures of Lister, Gualtieri and Knorr. The first
  of these figures is accidentally more ventricose; the second, like all
  the other figures of Gualtieri, is defective at the apex; and Knorr's I
  suspect has been outrageously coloured from the real pink-mouthed
  <i>Achatina</i>.</p>

  <p>It inhabits the coast of Guinea; and I am informed the animal is eaten
  by the natives.</p>

<h5><img src="images/separator.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex;" alt="" /></h5>

  <p>For this beautiful and extraordinary bird I am indebted to Miss E.
  Yeates, of the Dingle near Liverpool, who received it from South America.
  Its general habit clearly points it out as belonging to the
  <i>Baccavoræ</i> or Berryeaters, apparently connecting the genera
  <i>Procnias</i> and <i>Pipra</i>, where Temminck with much judgement has
  also placed it, in the new edition of his <i>Manuel d'Ornithologie</i>
  just received, and before reading which I had considered the genus as
  unpublished.</p>

  <p>The total length is nine inches, of which the tail occupies four and a
  half. The bill is whitish, and is remarkably short, measuring only three
  lines from the nostrils to the tip, but three quarters of an inch from
  the angle of the mouth, which opens just under the eye: the plumage is
  singularly variegated: the crown of the head is furnished with a crest,
  which, when not elevated, is scarcely seen, and appears a deep glossy
  black mixed with grey and rufous; but when erected it is very
  conspicuous, and all the feathers are bright rufous tipt more or less
  with black; the upper sides of the head grey, the lower part and ears
  deep-black; the neck above is greyish-white, with blackish transverse
  lines: the back, scapulars, rump and tail-covers are varied transversely
  with olive, shining black, and bright yellow, each feather being olive at
  the base, black in the middle, and yellow at the tip. Beneath the
  feathers of the chin and part of the throat are somewhat lengthened,
  semi-setaceous, and of a bright yellow; the neck and breast are white,
  with two transverse lines of deep black on each feather; these lines
  diminish, and are broken into spots on the body, and nearly disappear on
  the vent: the edges of the breast-feathers are tipt with yellow, which
  colour increases downwards on the vent and tail-covers, which latter are
  entirely yellow. The wings are four inches long, uniform deep black with
  a blue gloss, much pointed, and calculated for rapid flight. Tail the
  same colour, the exterior basal margins olive: all the feathers are
  narrow, pointed, and gradually lengthening, the middle pair being two
  inches three quarters longer than the outer pair, which exceed those next
  them by an inch. The feet are very pale yellow, and three-quarters of an
  inch from the knee to the claws, the three foremost of which are equally
  connected together (though slightly) nearly as far as the first joint;
  the outer and inner toes equal, and rather shorter than the hind-toe:
  claws slender and much compressed.</p>

  <p>Whether this species is the same as the one mentioned by Temminck as
  existing in the French Museum under the name of <i>P. flavirostris</i>,
  it is quite impossible to say, as the description of that bird has never
  been published. This leads me to notice a custom several naturalists of
  the present day have lately adopted, of publishing names, and names only,
  of new or undescribed animals, which they then wish to be considered as
  permanently fixed, and as having thus secured to themselves all the merit
  of first describing. Now this at best is but a surreptitious path to
  fame, and in many instances bears the appearance of originating in a
  petty vanity, quite beneath the dignity of true science: it is easily
  fixing a name to an object which we have not before seen, or suspect may
  be new, without the trouble of investigating authors and comparing
  synonyms: the name may remain, but if it should afterwards be discovered
  as hasty and erroneous, its author is in no way amenable to the opinions
  and criticisms of others, for they cannot discover such mistakes when no
  clue is given them beyond a name, which may frequently be applicable to
  half a dozen species. If, on the other hand, the object is really new,
  the scientific world is still in the dark, for without a description the
  name conveys nothing. Besides this, it has a tendency to deprive those
  writers of their well-earned merit, who undergo the laborious but
  necessary investigation of books, the examining and comparing of
  specimens, and the construction of sound characters previous to their
  publishing a new addition to the great volume of Nature. Against this
  <i>scientific monopoly</i> a stand should be made, and all names either
  of families, genera, or species should be totally rejected, unless their
  meaning is clearly defined. Let those who run the race, receive the
  wreath; and not let it be snatched from the winning-post by another, who
  jumps from behind and claims it as his own.</p>

  <p>On a careful examination of my specimen, I find the nostrils are not
  covered by a membrane, as observed by Temminck, but are open, obliquely
  and ovately round, and a narrow rim round the margin. That excellent
  ornithologist likewise remarks that the first and second quill-feathers
  are the longest; but my bird (which, however, is in full plumage) has the
  first and third of equal length and shorter than the second, which is
  longest. These nice distinctions lead me to suppose the species from
  which his generic character was taken, is distinct from this.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Psaris</i> was first instituted with great propriety by
  Cuvier; and before the discovery of the species now made known, was
  supposed to consist of only one, the Cayenne Shrike of Latham, which with
  the present bird (named in honour of the first zoologist of the age) is
  found in Brazil. The figure is nearly of the natural size.</p>

  <p>Total length five inches and a half. Bill blueish, three quarters of
  an inch from the angle of the mouth, and four-tenths from the nostrils,
  which are ovately round, rather large, and simple, being entirely devoid
  of an external membrane, but the base is partially covered with small
  thick-set, short, setaceous feathers; between the eye and base of the
  bill are a few weak and short hairs; the upper part of the head, as far
  as the nape, is capped by deep-black, having a blueish gloss: between the
  nostrils and the eye, as well as on the chin and throat, the colour is
  white, which changes to a pale cinereous grey on the sides of the head
  and round the neck; the ears at their base and margin of the eye tinged
  with yellow; the rest of the upper plumage yellowish-olive. The under
  plumage on the lower part of the neck and breast, the sides, and the
  inner wing-covers are clear yellow, and from that to the vent white.
  Wings two inches long, the quills brown, margined externally with olive
  and internally with yellow; the first and second quill progressively
  shorter than the third and fourth, which are of equal length. Tail short,
  slightly divaricated; olive, with whitish marginal tips. Legs
  blueish-black; the three fore-toes are equally cleft, but a membrane will
  be found connecting them equally at the base nearly as far as the first
  joint.</p>

  <p>Temminck must be mistaken in giving as a generic character to this
  genus, that the external toe is connected to the middle one as far as the
  first joint, and the inner toe cleft to the base; at least such is not
  the case either in my specimens of this bird or in those of the Cayenne
  Shrike: and they have been carefully relaxed in warm water, the best
  method of ascertaining such peculiarities.</p>

  <p>This insect is the most common (although hitherto unfigured) of a
  striking natural group belonging to the <i>Hesperidæ</i>; it has
  therefore been selected as the best example for the genus I have now
  formed them into. I have not seen more than twelve or fourteen species,
  and these were all from different parts of South America, to which I have
  no doubt the genus is exclusively confined. The club of their antennæ is
  very thick, obtuse, and without any terminal hook. The bright red at the
  end of the abdomen (improperly called by Fabricius the tail) is most
  conspicuous in the female, which is also larger and having the wings more
  obtuse, of which the upper and under surfaces are both alike.</p>

  <p>The insects of this family fly with amazing rapidity (as is shown by
  the thickness of their thorax, and the sharpness in the make of their
  wings), generally frequenting openings of thick woods and alighting on
  leaves where the sun strikes: I seldom saw them on flowers. Their wings
  when at rest are half expanded in a horizontal direction. Their
  metamorphosis is unknown.</p>

  <p>This individual species is scarce in the northern parts of Brazil, but
  common in the southern provinces.</p>

  <p>An inspection of a vast number of insects of this genus, with the
  possession of nearly all the species noticed by authors, convinces me
  that the insect now figured is perfectly distinct from any other. It is
  in the cabinet of Mr. Haworth, who obligingly lent it me for comparison
  and description, and is the only individual I have hitherto met with. The
  prolongation of the palpi, which is even more obvious than in <i>C.
  Statira</i>, is alone a specific distinction; and the form of the spots
  both on the upper and under side differs very much in character from that
  insect, with which it has the most affinity. It may be the <i>Papilio
  Drya</i> of Fabr. (omitting his references); but his description, whether
  intended for this insect or any other, is so vague that I can see no
  advantage in retaining it. Of the two bright silver spots beneath, one is
  oval, the other larger and quadrangular.</p>

  <p>This most elegant shell has been figured from one of the specimens
  that belonged to the late Mr. Jennings, who was well known to spare
  neither expense nor assiduity in procuring the most select and matchless
  specimens of every species; so much so, indeed, that such as are known to
  have been in his possession generally bear a higher price. One of these
  is now in my father's cabinet, the other in that of Mrs. Bolton, of
  Storr's-hall, Windermere. I have seen both, and they appear equally
  fine.</p>

  <p>I cannot help considering this as a distinct species from <i>Mitra
  caffra</i> (<i>Voluta caffra</i> Linn.), with which it has hitherto been
  placed only as a variety: it is much larger, the volutions more convex,
  but compressed on the suture, and the whole shell (except near the point)
  perfectly smooth: the beak or channel likewise, which in <i>M. caffra</i>
  is short and nearly straight, is in this lengthened and recurved. The
  mouth is very narrow (occasioned by the outer lip being thick and
  slightly inflexed) and smooth within, the terminal volutions slightly
  plaited, and the base of the shell grooved.</p>

  <p>The figures of Knorr and Martini are very bad, and give no correct
  idea of the shell, except its colour.</p>

  <p>Reverse shells, or such whose mouth when viewed in front is on the
  left side, are generally held in much estimation by collectors. This
  deviation from the usual form of shells is sometimes accidental, as in
  our common garden Snail and several others; while in some species it
  appears a constant, and therefore a specific distinction. Such I
  apprehend is the case with the shell now figured, a rare and very elegant
  species, apparently not noticed by any writer; two or three existing in
  the British Museum and one in my father's cabinet are all the specimens I
  have hitherto seen. The latter (here figured) came from Bahia in South
  America. The whole shell is very finely marked with longitudinal striæ,
  and the colouring better seen than described: the buff tinge at the base
  is occasioned by the remaining epidermis.</p>

  <p>This shell belongs to the second division of the genus <i>Achatina</i>
  as mentioned at <a href="#Plate30">Plate 30</a>, having the aperture much
  shorter than the spire and the base nearly entire. <i>Bulla virginea</i>
  of Linn. seems to connect the two divisions, having the lengthened spire
  of one and the truncated base of the other.</p>

  <p>I am indebted for this new bird to Miss E. Yeates, who received it
  with a few others from some part of Brazil: it seems to connect the
  genera of <i>Ampelis</i> and <i>Procnias</i>, having the bill much less

  <p>Total length eight inches and three quarters. Bill in extreme length
  near an inch; the colour dark cinereous; the base furnished with bristles
  something resembling the Chatterers: the opening of the nostrils large,
  round, terminal, and nearly naked; the feathers on the crown lengthened;
  the whole head, neck, and fore-part of the breast black, bordered above

  <p>The descriptions left by Fabricius of this as well as many other

  short, that unless a figure is quoted to elucidate them, it becomes
  totally impossible to ascertain the precise species intended. Such is the
  case with the present insect, which will not agree with any described by
  Fabricius, or figured by Cramer.</p>

  <p>During my travels in Brazil I never met with this species, but am
  indebted to my liberal friend Dr. Langdorff, Russian Consul-general at

  dots, and another behind: the posterior wings above have a narrow whitish
  margin, the colour beneath much paler; but the nerves on this, as well as
  at the tips of the anterior wings, are blackish-brown; the legs at the
  base and the tarsi are black.</p>

  <p>The different sexes of this insect will appear so strikingly

  are persuaded confirm the fact.</p>

  <p>The male insect is distinguished (like all the <i>Hesperidæ</i>) by
  having the eyes considerably larger, and the anterior wings more narrowed
  than in the other sex: in this species the bands on their wings assume
  the form of three yellowish spots, adjoining which, on the inner side, is
  a semi-lunular villous mark, an almost constant indication (where it
  exists) of this sex. The straw-coloured border beneath the posterior
  wings is narrower and darker than in the female; but in both it forms a
  slender marginal fringe on the upper surface. Legs deep rufous; antennæ
  black; the club beneath and lunule round the eye straw-coloured.</p>

  <p>The species of this and one or two other genera of land-shells are
  subject to such variability in their colouring, that it becomes extremely
  difficult to ascertain which are species and which varieties. The shell
  now figured might, on a cursory glance, very well pass for one of the
  Protean varieties of the Linnæan <i>Bulla fasciata</i>; but a comparison
  with that shell will at once point out the strong specific difference
  that exists between them in the formation of the mouth. In this, the
  lower half of the inner lip, or more properly the pillar, is nearly
  straight; the base entire, or without any notch or truncated appearance:
  whereas in the true <i>A. fasciata</i>, the inner lip at the base is very
  much curved inward, and notched before it joins the outer lip. The mouth
  is also short and broad: whereas in this it is much more oblong, and the
  base round. Other more obvious characters exist in the form of the
  whorls, spire, and more particularly in the colour, of these two shells;
  but these are in comparison of minor importance.</p>

  <p>I regret having but one example of this shell, as it prevents me from
  tracing how far the characters here detailed hold good in other
  specimens. They are such, however, as, I think, fully to justify the
  propriety of considering it a species.</p>

  <p>Its locality is unknown.</p>

  <p>I have little doubt more than one species exist among the supposed
  varieties of the true <i>Bulla fasciata</i> of Linn., which I take to be
  the shell figured by Lister.</p>

  <p>No family of shells possess characters more strikingly obvious to
  common observers than the Olives; and yet, although in our English
  terminology no one would ever think of calling them <i>Volutes</i>, we
  still shrink from giving them that distinguishing appellation in Latin
  which we every day use and acknowledge in our own language. The strict
  followers of Linnæus, by thus rejecting generic distinctions, which at
  once convey a definite idea of form and structure, contribute to render
  systematic arrangement less expressive of ideas than the common
  nomenclature of our sale catalogues: a striking proof of the pertinacity
  with which we cherish those particular doctrines we first imbibed,
  although an unbiassed reasoning and an attentive observance of nature
  would convince us of their fallacy.</p>

  <p>The great Linnæus, at the time he formed that system which laid the
  foundation of systematic nomenclature, had not the materials for
  gathering and combining those natural genera which the immense
  discoveries made since his death have given us a knowledge of. He
  accordingly arranged those few shells known to him, in large, and for the
  most part natural, groups. That of <i>Voluta</i> I consider as one of
  these last (excepting the first division); but the great accession of
  species now known, and which is still increasing, has long ago induced
  the principal Continental writers to divide this very extensive family
  into the following genera: <i>Marginella</i> (Date shells), <i>Oliva</i>
  (Olives), <i>Mitra</i> (Mitres), <i>Turbinellus</i> (Turnip shells),
  <i>Voluta</i> (Volutes), <span class="correction" title="Original read 'and Cimbium (Melons)', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >...</span>; all possessing not only clear but natural characters;
  inasmuch as, by such an arrangement, those interesting links and
  ramifications that connect this family with the <i>Bullæ</i>,
  <i>Cones</i>, <i>Cowries</i>, <i>Murices</i>, and other genera, can be
  traced; and which perhaps affords the most fascinating and intellectual
  source of contemplation and study the science can bestow.</p>

  <p>The peculiarity of this species will distinguish it among this
  numerous and intricate family. The basal suture is deeply channeled;
  those on the spire covered by the polished callosity which spreads from
  the inner lip.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dillwyn has adopted the unpublished name of Solander, although the
  shell had long ago been described and named by Martini and Lamarck. I
  consider this as contrary to that principle of nomenclature which awards
  a preference to priority of publication; and I have therefore restored
  the name of those authors who have this undoubted claim. Mr. Dillwyn's
  description is very clear and good.</p>

  <p>I cannot learn from what particular part of Brazil this species has
  been received.</p>

  <p>The Yellow-tufted Honeysucker, although described by Latham, has
  hitherto remained unfigured; and I therefore select it as an excellent
  example of a tribe of birds which I think are peculiar to Australasia,
  and which seem to hold the same situation among the birds of that vast
  country as the Humming-birds occupy in South America, and the Sun-birds
  (<i>Cinnyris</i>, Cuvier) in Africa and India; all of which more or less
  derive their sustenance from the nectar of flowers, and which they
  extract on the wing by means of their long tubular tongues.</p>

  <p>It is singular, that while our first ornithological writers were
  distributing the numerous species of these birds in their systems, under
  such of the Linnæan genera as they thought most adapted for their
  reception, a naturalist of a remote colony should be the first who, by
  creating a new genus, brought them all into their proper situation in
  systematic arrangement; one of the many proofs that Nature, and Nature
  only, is to be studied; and that no system, however ingenious or however
  applauded, can be considered as infallible.</p>

  <p>By an error (no doubt of the press) in the specific character of this
  bird in Latham's Index, the eye stripe is called <i>white</i>, though in
  the description it is termed black. Mr. Stephens has copied this error
  into "General Zoology;" and his description of this bird, as well as
  numberless others, seems merely an abridgement or alteration of Latham's;
  a practice highly detrimental to science; for, when an original
  description cannot be obtained, it is much better, and safer, to copy
  without disguise that of another.</p>

  <p>How far all the birds included by Temminck in this genus really belong
  to it, admits of very great doubt; I have therefore constructed the
  generic character from those birds of New Holland only which Lewin, who
  founded the genus, must have had before him.</p>

  <p>Total length seven inches and a half; bill seven-tenths, the frontal
  feathers advancing half its length to the nostrils; those of the ears are
  lengthened, but the yellow tuft behind them is much more so; the feathers
  of the chin are small, thick-set, and ending in fine setaceous hairs
  curved outwards; the breast and body pale brownish-yellow. Quills and
  tail dark-brown, margined with deep-yellowish; the two lateral
  tail-feathers tipt with dirty white; plumage above olive-brown; front and
  crown of the head dark brownish-yellow; bill black; legs brownish,
  inner-toe very deeply cleft. Tail, from the rump, three inches and a half
  long, and slightly rounded.</p>

  <p>Latham, who first described this bird, says, "it makes its nest on the
  extreme pendent branches of low trees or shrubs, and by this means
  escapes the plunder of smaller quadrupeds." It appears not uncommon in
  New South Wales.</p>

  <p>All those species of the Linnæan Toucans having a long wedge-shaped
  tail, and the nostrils passing through the upper part of the bill, are
  comprehended by Illiger and other continental writers under this genus.
  They have been called by the French Aracari; which name I have retained
  as an English generic distinction. They inhabit the same country and
  situations as the real Toucans, which are distinguished by having a
  short, broad, and even tail, and the nostrils placed behind the bill.</p>

  <p>A fine example of this very rare bird I first met with in the small
  collection sent to my excellent friend, E. Falkener, Esq. from the
  Spanish Main. I have since noticed another which was in Mr. Bullock's
  museum, and is now in the possession of Lord Stanley: these are the only
  two specimens known.</p>

  <p>This bird was first described by me in the Journal of the Royal
  Institution near a year ago. When Professor Temminck was in England, I
  showed him the manuscript description and drawing which I had then made:
  he assured me he had never seen the bird before, otherwise than in
  Bullock's museum. A short time after, my account of it was published. I
  observe, however, that in the new edition of his Manuel he gives this
  name to a new bird of his own: no description however follows, and it is
  therefore impossible to say if the Professor intends it for this
  identical species.</p>

  <p>We must postpone any further observations on this family, and conclude
  by giving the original description above alluded to.</p>

  <p>Total length twelve inches, of which the bill in extreme length
  measures three. It is much curved, and more attenuated than any of the
  Aracaris, being thickest at the base; from which it narrows to a sharp
  point at the tip. The upper part is convex, and somewhat thickened; the
  sides are compressed, and the upper mandible has two broad slightly
  indented grooves on each side: the base has a few transverse wrinkles,
  and the serratures deep and unequal. The lower mandible half the depth of
  the upper, the sides concave, and the teeth less. The colour (in the
  dried bird) black; the base of the lower and the upper half of the
  superior mandible rufous, the base with a whitish marginal line. The
  nostrils are more lateral than usual, being placed in a line with the
  eye; the orbits naked and reddish brown, the feathers encircling which
  (particularly beneath the eye) are vivid cerulean blue. The whole upper
  plumage is parrot green, paler beneath, with a gloss of golden yellow on
  the cheeks and sides: throat dusky white. Wings short, five inches long,
  and rounded; inner shafts of the quills black, margined with whiteish.
  Tail cuneated, green, four inches and a half long, the four middle
  feathers equal. Legs dusky black.</p>

  <p>No tribe of Birds appear so void of that symmetry of form that in
  general pervades the feathered creation, as the Toucans and Aracaris in
  the new, and the Hornbills in the old continent. A question naturally
  arises, why the bills of these birds should be so monstrously out of
  proportion, and what possible use they can be applied to. The elucidation
  of these questions is highly interesting, and calls for the most accurate
  observations to be made in their native regions. It will be sufficient
  for the present, however, to point out, with regard to the Linnæan
  Toucans, that the accurate observations and anatomical knowledge of my
  valued friend Dr. Traill, F.R.S.E., of Liverpool, have clearly proved
  that an immense number of nerves and fibres fill the cavity of these
  bills, all connected with the organs of smelling, which are in the
  highest state of development. A short notice on this subject will be
  found in the Linnæan Transactions; but as my learned friend is pursuing
  his inquiries further on the subject, I shall for the present confine my
  remarks to the individual here illustrated, observing that no birds are
  so little understood, even in regard to the species, as these.</p>

  <p>The indefatigable Edwards appears the first who noticed this bird. His
  description, though in the quaint style of the day, is clear and
  comprehensive; and his figure strengthens it, both being made from the
  living bird. Yet Dr. Latham has quite overlooked it as a variety of
  another species; and Dr. Shaw, although he copies Edwards's account,
  gives references which belong to other birds. It is not in the costly
  work of Le Vaillant, and indeed seems (from its excessive rarity) to have
  escaped the notice of all modern ornithologists. The perfect bill of the
  bird is, however, in my possession, minutely agreeing with Edwards's
  account; and also an original sketch in oil of another individual, by an
  unknown artist, with a note stating it was done from the life at Exeter
  'Change. All these testimonies put the existence of the bird beyond any
  doubt.</p>

  <p>Having seen only the bill, which is well described by Edwards, I shall
  close this article with such part of his description as appears
  necessary.</p>

  <p>"The bill is very large, compressed sideways, having <i>a sharp ridge
  along the upper part</i>; the upper mandible is green, with a long
  triangular spot of yellow colour on each side, and the ridge on the upper
  part yellow; the lower mandible is blue, with a shade of green in the
  middle, the point is red, it hath about five faint dusky bars, which
  cross the joinings of the two mandibles. The iris of the eye is a fair
  green colour; round the eye is a broad space of naked skin of a violet
  colour: the throat and breast are of a bright yellow, below which is a
  bar of scarlet feathers; the covert feathers of the tail are white above,
  beneath of a bright red; the legs and feet are all of a blue or violet
  colour." Edwards says it was brought from Jamaica, but doubts its being
  rather a native of the continent: he says they are very rarely brought
  home alive.</p>

  <p>The bill is full six inches long, and the whole figure on the same
  scale, both in this and in Edwards.</p>

  <p>This variable species is perhaps the most beautiful and delicate in
  its colouring of all the terrestrial snails; yet, although figured by
  several of the older writers, so little justice has been done it, that we
  make no apology for introducing it into the present work, both on this
  account, and for the purpose of giving such a discriminative specific
  character as may lead to the inquiry, how far all the numerous varieties
  mentioned by authors really belong to this species or not. As far as my
  own observation goes, I have found that the thickened spire, the
  depression of the whorls on the suture, and the narrowness or contraction
  of the mouth at the base, afford the only constant characters; for, in
  regard to colour and the situation of the mouth, both appear subject to
  great variation, the latter being as often reversed as regular. Martini's
  is the only figure that can be safely quoted for this variety.</p>

  <p>I am indebted to Mrs. Bolton, of Storr's-hall, Windermere, for the
  loan of this and several other rare shells: it formerly belonged to Mr.
  Jennings, and appears an old shell, being heavy in proportion, the
  umbilicus thickly closed up, and the outer-lip very thick. Another I have
  seen at Mrs. Mawe's, and one is in the British Museum: but the finest
  specimen in colour and preservation is in the possession of my friend W.
  J. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Broederip', see Addenda et Corrigenda"
  >Broderip</span>, Esq., of Lincoln's-Inn: from this it seems the spiral
  whorls are finely and delicately marked by transverse elevated striæ,
  while those on the basal volution are striated transversely, though in a
  less regular manner.</p>

  <p>Bruguiere mentions that this species is generally found in the South
  American islands, Cayenne, and Guiana.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dillwyn has given the new name of <i>aurea</i> to this shell, in
  addition to the five others under which different authors have described
  it. Such changing of names and multiplication of synonyms, without strong
  reasons, are very objectionable. I have retained that of
  <i>Bruguiere</i>, as being the only author who has placed it in its
  proper genus.</p>

  for the facilities he has afforded me in prosecuting the present work:
  one of these is now figured; it differs in no respect from that in the

  <p>Having seen but a single specimen of this shell, I have placed it as a
  distinct species, not without some doubts, and principally for the
  purpose of calling the attention of conchologists to a more rigid
  examination of the specific distinctions of this family (unconnected with
  colour) than has heretofore been done. The regular convexity of the
  whorls, not in any degree compressed at the suture, the want of that
  thickened appearance on the spire, and of the contraction at the base of
  the mouth (all which characters I have found in the varieties of <i>B.
  citrinus</i> to be constant), afford a specific distinction which future
  observations must confirm or annul. Bruguiere notices a variety of <i>B.
  citrinus</i> which is entirely yellow, a most beautiful specimen of which
  is in the British Museum, and which possesses (as well as the excellent
  figure of Gualtieri) all the specific characters I have given to <i>B.
  citrinus</i>, but not of the present shell. Lister's figure, on the
  contrary, is rude, though very characteristic of this; and Martini's
  representation, here cited, also appears the same.</p>

  <p>All the writers I have been able to consult, uniformly describe this
  species as having a coloured band on the white ground of the shell. In
  the Banksian cabinet are two fine specimens, and which have enabled me to
  ascertain that this brown band is nothing more than an epidermis, or
  external coating, with which the shell is only partially covered&mdash;a
  circumstance of very rare occurrence; and which, being removed, proves
  the real colour of the shell to be of a uniform polished white. This,
  together with its excessive rarity, and the opportunity of giving
  original figures, has induced me to include it in this work, although it
  exists both in those of Martini and Martyn above quoted. I have neither
  seen nor heard of specimens being in any other collection, besides the
  two above noticed; and which no doubt were collected by their late
  lamented possessor on some of the South Sea islands. A striking affinity
  exists between this and <i>M. zonata</i> figured at the <a

  resemblance, in fact, to a small olive, may have occasioned its being
  hitherto overlooked. The spire is slightly wrinkled and striated; the

  considered with much judgement by Professor Temminck as a new genus,
  having the perfect bill and habit of the Wryneck, but totally unlike that

  error of the press: no mention, however, is made of the beautiful crimson
  colour which adorns the crest.</p>

  with a concealed crest, which is vivid crimson at the base and blackish

  <p>The general resemblance between this and the European Kingsfisher may
  have been the cause why it has remained hitherto unnoticed by
  ornithologists. It bears, however, on closer inspection, a strong and
  peculiar distinction in the crest at the back of the head, in being much
  smaller in size, and especially as inhabiting the hottest parts of India;
  while our own braves the cold of a Siberian winter.</p>

  <p>Total length six inches, of which the bill from the angle of the mouth
  to the tip occupies one inch and three-quarters, and is black, with the
  under mandible paler; the ears and the upper part of the head and neck
  are blueish-black, transversely banded with somewhat crescent-shaped
  narrow bands of a rich deep blue, which are broken into spots on the
  crest and ears: from the base of the under mandible is a black stripe
  richly glossed with blue, and carried down on each side the neck, between
  which and the upper part is a whitish stripe beginning just behind the
  ears (this in the European species is rufous). The wing-covers, scapulars
  and lesser quills are blackish glossed with blue, the two former having a
  bright spot at the end of each feather; superior and greater quills
  entirely blackish; down the middle of the back, rump, and tail-covers,
  light and vivid blue, with a slight tinge of greenish; chin and throat
  cream-colour; line between the nostrils and eyes, margin of the
  shoulders, under wing-covers, and all the lower parts of the body,
  rufous; tail deep and obscure blue; legs red.</p>

  proportion, and real sexual distinction, as well as geography, I cannot
  but consider the question still remains doubtful; and although I am not
  at present prepared to offer an opinion as to the actual affinity between
  these three insects, I have little or no doubt that the one now figured
  is a really distinct species from either of the above, which all inhabit
  various parts of India. This, on the contrary, is from the interior of
  the Cape of Good Hope, from whence it was brought by Mr. Burchall, among
  whose insects I have seen about twenty unvarying specimens, but they were
  all males. I discovered however three or four of both sexes, varying in
  size, in Mr. Haworth's cabinet, and the perfect similarity in colour of
  the female with the other sex is very striking: it wants of course the
  little tuft of hair and opaque spot within the borders of the wings, so
  generally found in the male <i>Coliadæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The distinctions of <i>Colias Pyrene</i> as a species rest on the
  areola of the anterior wings being considerably larger in proportion than
  in the others allied to it, thus making the black dot (which is always
  placed at the outer extremity of the areola) much nearer the tip than the
  base: these wings are also more sharply trigonal (in the male), and have
  only the slightest appearance of a black margin; the hinder wings are
  also perfectly entire, and not obtusely undulated as in those insects,
  and the sexes not differing in colour. Like most of the insects of this
  genus, the ocellate spots beneath vary considerably; sometimes they are
  silvery, at other times not; the anal valves in the male are short and
  obtuse, and the wings in the female not so sharply pointed.</p>

  <p>No two insects can present a more striking dissimilarity than the
  sexes of this species; and it was only after a considerable degree of
  attention to the subject, in their native climate, that we were at last
  thoroughly convinced that <i>Colias argante</i> and <i>C. Cnidia</i>
  were, without the least remaining doubt, the male and the female of one
  species. I have had the same opinion communicated to me by my friend Dr.
  Langsdorff, whose long residence and observations in Brazil render his
  opinion of no small authority.</p>

  <p>As both insects are well known, and their distinctions given in the
  specific character, it will be only necessary to observe, that the under
  surfaces of the wings in both sexes vary much both in the density of the
  minute dots, and short undulated stripes that spread over their surface;
  and that the silvery spots in some males are strongly marked, and in
  others quite obsolete: there is, in very fine individuals of this sex, a
  faint bloom of pink spread on the orange of the upper surface, which
  heightens the vivid yet chaste beauty of the insect. The females are not
  so common. I met with them both in northern and southern Brazil, and have
  seen them in collections from Parà directly under the equinoctial
  line.</p>

  <p>We introduce this common shell for the purpose of pointing out those
  characters which induce us to consider it more as a distinct species than
  as a variety of <i>S. Luhuanus</i> of authors; and this consists not so
  much in the colour of the inner lip, as in the almost total absence of
  that important part, which this shell invariably exhibits through all its
  growths: it is therefore, I think, contradictory to the meaning of the
  word to term that variable which is found to be constant, particularly
  where the point of distinction rests on a marked difference of
  <i>formation</i> no less than of colour, though both shells are common to
  the Oriental seas. Minor differences exist, in the mouth of this always
  being pink, the inner lip white, and the outer lip but slightly lobed (or
  cut out) above: in <i>S. Luhuanus</i> the mouth is deep scarlet, inner
  lip black and highly polished, and the outer lip deeply notched above;
  the two former characters, indeed, begin to show themselves at a very
  early growth of the shell.</p>

  <p>This beautiful and highly interesting shell has been generally
  considered <i>unique</i> among the collections in this country. It was
  originally in the possession of the late Mr. Jennings, and, I am informed
  by Captain Laskey, was on first being received, in a much finer state.
  Mr. Jennings had it cleaned, and in so doing many of the delicate
  transverse striæ were partially obliterated, and the sharp ridges on the
  longitudinal ribs worn down, as indeed was apparent from a drawing
  Captain L. had made of the shell previous to this unmerciful cleaning. It
  however still remains a very fine shell, and is now in the cabinet of
  Mrs. Bolton, of Storr's-hall, to whom I am obliged for the opportunity of
  now publishing it.</p>

  <p>The figure and specific character will sufficiently point out its
  distinctions. The body-whorl is smooth, but strongly granulated at the
  base; the spire delicately striated between the ribs; the two last whorls
  before the apex are close, thick, and somewhat papillary; the apex itself
  small and sharp. The upper part of the inner lip has some faint obsolete
  teeth, but the base has three very strong ones.</p>

  <p>It connects in the most beautiful manner the two genera of
  <i>Mitra</i> and <i>Voluta</i>. Its country is unknown.</p>

  <p>Under the genus <i>Solen</i> (vulgarly called Razors or Pods) are
  comprehended a variety of shells having the common character of both
  extremities open or gaping when the valves are together, yet differing
  materially in their form, teeth, and general appearance: some are long,
  slender and straight; others more or less curved; a few short and oval,
  or with one end only lengthened. Modern writers have, however, retained
  nearly all these in the genus as left by Linnæus; and this method for the
  present is more desirable than that of creating a multiplicity of genera.
  Dr. Turton, in his very useful Conchological Dictionary, enumerates
  thirteen species as found on the British coast, including the <i>Solen
  Novacula</i> of Montagu, which the Doctor suspects is not truly a
  species. The original specimens which Montagu described I have carefully
  inspected at the British Museum, and have no doubt in my own mind they
  are in reality no other than <i>S. Siliqua</i> with one of the cardinal
  teeth broken off; a circumstance which, from their fragility, frequently
  happens, even in opening the recent shell.</p>

  <p><i>Solen ambiguus</i> was first described by Lamarck, who says it is
  from North America. Two or three specimens are in my possession; but it
  is a rare species, much thicker, and with larger teeth than any other;
  the epidermis is pale-brown, and in some parts obliquely lineated.</p>

  <p>The descriptions of Dr. Latham, and the compilations of Dr. Shaw on
  the various species of Toucans, are so confused, and their synonyms so
  inaccurate, that it is quite impossible to quote them in reference to
  this bird; but which I am informed has already been distinguished by the
  celebrated Illiger as a distinct species, under the name here
  adopted.</p>

  <p>Independent of colour, this differs from <i>R. Tucanus</i> in having
  the bill less curved, the top convex and obscure pink, not flat and blue.
  The belt at the base is always vivid blue (grey in the dead bird), not,
  as in <i>R. Tucanus</i>, of a rich yellow. This I have never met with in
  Brazil; the other is common from lat. 8 to 23° S. A drawing from the live
  bird by the late Sydenham Edwards (obligingly lent me by Lord Stanley)
  confirms others I have seen as to the colour of the bill, orbits, &amp;c.
  It varies, however, in that of the throat, breadth of the red band, and
  in the tail-covers. A specimen I possess being somewhat larger, the
  breast is nearly white, and the upper tail-covers sulphur. In young birds
  the white on the sides is tinged with grey. I am inclined to consider the
  <i>Grand Toucan à ventre rouge</i> of Vaillant as a mere variety, having
  the red pectoral bar very broad.</p>

  <p>In general size it is rather larger than the Brazilian Toucan. Our
  figure is on the exact scale of four-tenths to an inch. Its precise
  locality I am unacquainted with. We hope to enlarge more on this
  interesting genus in another publication.</p>

  <p>This is one of the most natural genera in the modern systems of
  conchology, as it includes all fresh-water bivalves having two rough
  cardinal teeth in one valve and one in the other. The colours of all are
  more or less dark-brown, sometimes radiated with green; but the specific
  characters rest on the contour of the shell and the proportion of the
  teeth.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt this shell is the <i>Unio nasutus</i> of Say,
  who refers to the figure of Lister. The <i>Unio nasuta</i> however of
  Lamarck I apprehend will be found different, as he seems to think; his
  shell also is purple inside with short thick teeth; indeed so much
  uncertainty hangs on the shells of this genus, that the species can only
  be fixed by ample descriptions and very correct figures. The figure is
  from a shell in the Linnæan Society's cabinet. Mr. Say says it is common
  in the Delaware River, North America.</p>

  <p>A few specimens of this most delicate and beautiful shell were found
  by my brother, Mr. J. T. Swainson, jun. in the island of Cuba; nor am I
  aware of its having by any other means reached our cabinets, excepting a
  distinct variety which occurred in Mrs. Angus's, and is now (together
  with a young one of the same) in Mr. Dubois's collection. This has, in
  addition to the green bands on the spire, a row of bead-like cinereous
  spots at the base of the first and second spiral whorl; and others of a
  longitudinal square form on those whorls nearest the tip, which, with the
  inner lip, is slightly tinged with pink. The form of the shell also is
  shorter; but the general contour, and particularly the crenated mouth,
  common to both, clearly proves it can be considered only as a distinct
  variety. The specimen we have figured agrees with all those sent at the
  same time, in having not the slightest appearance of spots, though in a
  perfect state of preservation. The little notches on the margin of the
  lip are always placed at the commencement of each of the green lines; the
  base of the column is straight, and slightly truncated before it joins
  the outer lip.</p>

  <p>The vast and little known region of New Holland has afforded us some
  of the most beautiful birds of this superb family, and among which the
  species now, as we believe, for the first time published, will stand
  conspicuous. It is from a fine skin in the possession of Mr. Leadbeater,
  and is named in honour of the late M. Barraband, the first ornithological
  painter that France or any other country has produced.</p>

  <p>The tail is very long, measuring eight inches three quarters; the
  total length of the bird being near fifteen inches. The green which
  predominates over the plumage is bright and changeable, having a blueish
  tinge on the hind head, which is much darker and stronger on the outer
  margins of the quills and middle of the tail-feathers: the back and
  scapulars are tinged with an olive-brown; the spurious quills and their
  protecting covers are greenish-blue, appearing in some lights entirely of
  the latter colour; the inner margin of the quills and tail, as well as
  their entire under surface, deep brownish-black; but the tips of the
  tail-feathers beneath are much paler; the two middle feathers five inches
  longer than the outermost, and extending near two inches beyond any of
  the others; their extremities instead of being pointed are rather widened
  and rounded. Bill red; ears and space between the eye and bill green;
  fore-part of the head, chin, and half the neck, a clear orange-yellow,
  which is terminated by a narrow collar of a beautiful orange-red; the
  remaining under plumage pale-green; inner wing-covers darker. Legs black.
  The fourth, fifth and sixth quills notched at their tips.</p>

  <p>A lovely insect, which is unfigured, and, as far as we can ascertain,
  undescribed by any author. It appertains to the Linnæan genus
  <i>Sphinx</i>, which can be viewed (from the immense diversity and great
  number of the species) only as a family containing many and striking
  natural genera: in modern arrangement it is most nearly allied to the
  <i>Sesiæ</i> of Fabricius, from which, as it strikingly differs in the
  formation of the palpi and antennæ, I have separated it.</p>

  <p>I have named this insect to commemorate the exertions of Mr. Abbott,
  well known as having furnished the materials for that beautiful work the
  Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia, edited by Sir James Edward Smith. And
  from the unpublished drawings of this zealous collector, the larva and
  pupa have been figured. Mr. Abbott writes that it is a rare species in
  Georgia, and feeds on the grape. The female differs not in colour from
  the male, which is here represented.</p>

  <p>Of this genus, hitherto considered as possessing only a unique
  example, we were fortunate in discovering while in Sicily the new species
  now figured, and which early in the year visit the coasts near Palermo
  and Messina in prodigious quantities. There is no striking difference
  between this and <i>A. Tobianus</i>, excepting the extraordinary shape of
  the dorsal fin, which is invariably undulated and narrowed in the middle.
  It never grows to a size exceeding the figure, and is usually much less;
  while the British species is often found double the length. Like that,
  also, <i>A. Siculus</i> has the lateral line running close to the dorsal
  fin; for the fine line in the middle of the side, as Lacepede has well
  observed, is that only which connects the muscles. That author likewise
  mentions, that the jaws in <i>A. Tobianus</i> have minute teeth, but
  these I could never discover. The rays of the fins are, pect. 16; dorsal
  56; anal 30.</p>

  <p>We have had much difficulty in the investigation of this species: for
  its characters cannot be reconciled with any of those contained in
  Lamarck's Monograph of the genus in the <i>Annales du Museum</i>. With
  regard to the unnamed figures in the old authors, it bears the closest
  resemblance to that of <i>Gualtieri</i>, tab. 32. G, which Lamarck quotes
  for his <i>M. crocata</i>; but then his description is not at all
  applicable to our shell; and Mr. Dillwyn's synonyms of the Linnean <i>V.
  nodulosa</i> (where he has also included <i>M. crocata</i>), we are
  satisfied comprises two or even three distinct shells.</p>

  <p>This was named by Dr. Solander from the specimen in Mr. G. Humphrys's
  collection here figured: it is exceedingly rare, and its locality
  unknown. In form it resembles a <i>Buccinum</i>; the transverse grooves
  are broad, strongly defined, and have large and deep excavated dots
  within them; the upper part of each whorl has an appearance of irregular
  plaits, which makes the suture uneven, and takes off something from the
  smoothness of the lower part of the whorls, but the shell is in no way
  granulated.</p>

  <p>This (a common shell) can be no other than the <i>M. ferruginea</i> of
  Lamarck, though neither that author nor any other has noticed its primary
  distinguishing character, that of the uncommon thickness of the outer lip
  at the margin, which is also divided into convex obtuse crenations; in
  young shells this is not apparent; such is Martini's figure. Mr. Dillwyn
  has changed Lamarck's name to <i>Vitulina</i> for this, and given the

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
